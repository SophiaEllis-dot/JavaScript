<!-- hang man

i want the game to pick a random word from an array of words
[15:13]
and console.log     _
[15:14]
- - - - -
[15:14]
instead of the actual word
[15:14]
basically a dash for each character
[15:14]
the user then get to pick a letter
[15:15]
for example a
[15:15]
then the game will console.log - - -a - - a
[15:15]
basically anywhere a is visible it will appear in the string
[15:15]
if they get it wrong they loose a life from a maximum of 5 lifes
[15:15]
make sense?
[15:20]
you will probably need to learn how to do a for loop
[15:21]
so google for loop
[15:21]
and use a while loop to keep the game going while the still have lives
[15:21]
everything else can be recyled from rock paper scissors -->
